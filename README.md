# Probability Experiment Simulations

This project simulates various probability experiments, including coin tosses, die rolls, card draws, and compound events. It provides visual representations of the results to help understand probability concepts.

## How It Works

### Coin Toss Simulation
This simulation uses NumPy's random number generator to simulate flipping a coin 100 times. Each flip has two possible outcomes: heads (1) or tails (0). After running the simulation, the program counts the number of heads and tails and plots the results.

### Die Roll Simulation
The die roll simulation generates 60 random integers between 1 and 6, representing the faces of a standard six-sided die. It then counts the frequency of each outcome and displays the distribution in a bar plot.

### Card Draw Simulation
This simulation creates a virtual deck of cards where cards 1–26 are red and cards 27–52 are black. It shuffles the deck and draws 20 cards, then counts how many are red and how many are black.

### Compound Events Simulation
This simulation flips two coins 50 times and analyzes two scenarios:
- Both coins showing heads  
- At least one coin showing heads  
The results are displayed in two separate bar plots for comparison.
